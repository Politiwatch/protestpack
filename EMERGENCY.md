# Emergency
What to do if things go bad. In most cases, you'll want to **escape** — try to go to a different protest location or leave altogether. **Recording** is also usually a good idea, as people are more careful when they know they are being recorded.

## Tear gas
* **Move upwind** — the tear gas will move with the wind, so make sure not to be in its path.
* **Cover your eyes** — close your eyes and keep them covered to minimize irritation. A bandana might help.

## Rubber bullets & water cannons
* **Turn away** — your back is stronger than your front, so keep your face protected and turn away from the bullets.
* **Run away _or_ ground yourself** — decide between escaping or grounding yourself. To ground yourself, curl up on pavement in child's pose (to minimize contact areas) facing away from the main source of rubber bullets or of water cannons.

## Pepper spray
* **Rinse** — rinse your face with water.

## Stampede
* **Don't resist the flow** — move with the direction of the crowd and slowly work your way to the side.
* **Don't fall** — falling in a stampede could lead to serious injury or death.

## Violence
* **Stay away** — don't risk escalating the situation by getting involved.
* **Record** — people are more careful when they know they are being recorded.

## Shots fired
* **Get covered** — hide behind thick walls, cars' engines, and around buildings.
* **Check for injuries** — make sure you haven't been shot or otherwise injured. Adrenaline might mask the pain, so do a visual search.
