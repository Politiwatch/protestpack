# What to Bring
Because every protest is different, there isn't a single list of items that could possibly cover all situations. Still, there are some items that you _must_ have, and others that you might want to bring depending on the protest.

## Definitely Bring
1. **Backpack** — a backpack will help you store all your other items while keeping your hands free. A fanny-pack is also an option.
2. **Identification** — if you are arrested in the United States, police can detain you until you're identified. Having official government ID can help get you out of police custody faster.
3. **Water** — water can help quench thirst and rinse off chemicals.
4. **Light jacket or sweatshirt** — if it suddenly becomes cold, you'll be prepared. If not, you can just leave it in your bag.
5. **Snacks** — in case you get hungry or tired, make sure you have snacks prepared.
6. **Permanent marker** — a permanent marker will be useful if you need to write something down—like a license plate or phone number—quickly. You might also want to bring a notebook, but you can always also write on your arm.
7. **Glasses** — even if you don't wear glasses, some sort of eye protection will make you safer. Sunglasses work too.
8. **Smartphone** — a smartphone will allow you to communicate and take video. Make sure that your passcode lock is on, and that you use a secure messenger (we recommend [Signal](https://signal.org)) for communication. Bring an extra battery pack if you can.
9. **First aid kit** — injuries are bound to happen, and a simple first aid kit could keep you and your fellow protesters safe.
10. **Personal items** — whether this is sunscreen, tampons, or medications, make sure you have everything you need to survive for at least 48 hours (in case you're arrested).
11. **Friend** — don't protest alone. Go with a friend so you can look out for each other.

## Maybe Bring
1. **Bandana** — a bandana can protect your face from pepper spray.
2. **Hat** — a hat can protect you from the sun, the cold, and pepper spray.
3. **Swim goggles** — swim goggles will protect your eyes from tear gas and pepper spray.
4. **Mask** — depending on the protest, you might want to bring a mask to protect your identity in photos.
5. **Signage** — signs are an integral part of the modern-day protest.

## Don't Bring
1. **Contact lenses** — don't wear contact lenses to a protest. Your eyes won't be safe.
2. **Gun or other weaponry** — don't bring a weapon. If a protest turns violent, fighting back will only make the situation worse. Focus on escaping instead. Plus, bringing a weapon might agitate the police.
