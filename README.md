# ProtestPack
_by [Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org)_

Everything you need to know to be prepared for the next protest.

## Table of Contents
The following is the tentative table of contents for the three current sections of ProtestPack.

1. **What to know**
  * Your rights (per country)
  * Relationship between the government and the protest
  * The objective of the protest
  * The expected path & duration of the protest
  * How to get home
2. **What to do**
  * What to bring
  * How to avoid violence & stay safe
  * How to not get arrested
  * How to handle tear gas & pepper spray
  * How to effectively monitor police abuses
  * How to communicate safely
  * How to protect one's digital devices
  * How to escape
  * What to look for (plainclothes cops, isolated outbreaks of violence, split crowds, etc)

_ProtestPack will also offer an 8.5x11 'condensed' version that can be easily printed, put in one's pocket, and used as a reference._

Alternatively, this outline can be split into three categories: _before, during, after_.
