How to deal with police.

## If police approach
* **Keep your hands visible** — if they can't see your hands, they might think you have a weapon.
* **No sudden movements** — move slowly and predictably to avoid scaring the officers.
* **Record the police** — recording the police is legal, and it might keep the situation from escalating.
* **Ask if you can leave** — ask "may I leave?" and walk away without talking if the officer answers yes.
* **If you can't leave, ask why** — politely ask "for what crime?" if the officer says you can't leave.
* **Be polite** — yelling will only make the situation worse.
* **Don't touch the police** — if you touch the officer(s), you may be charged with assault.

## If you're searched
* **Don't give your consent** — say "I don't consent to this search." Keep in mind that warrantless pat-downs are legal in many areas.
* **Don't fight back** — if you fight back, you might be charged with assault.

## If you're arrested
* **Don't resist arrest** — this will just make your situation worse.
* **Document everything** — if you go to court, detailed evidence—like video—may help your case.
* **Don't argue or give excuses** — police misconduct isn't solved on the streets. Stay silent.
* **Stay silent, but give ID** — you don't have to answer their questions, but _do give identification_.
* **Memorize everything** — remember information like the officer's badge ID and the questions they ask.
* **Don't lie** — there is no reason to lie. Remain silent instead.
